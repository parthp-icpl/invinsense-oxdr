# Red Team and Breach and Attack Simulation Solution

### The Litmus Test of Your Cybersecurity That Also Helps to Achieve Continuous Cybersecurity Posture.

Cybersecurity is a continuous journey as attacks are a continuous process. This journey starts with having cybersecurity solutions that act as basic hygiene and provide preventive cybersecurity. Then comes detection and prevention, threat hunting and solutions and people needed for it. Once everything is done, organizations achieve a certain cybersecurity posture. Majority of the organizations stop here and a few go to test their cybersecurity posture, and very rare an organization goes beyond that and put its cybersecurity to continuous testing and implementing those results in achieving a cybersecurity posture that is dynamic and in response to the environment.
Invinsense RBAS helps organization to put their cybersecurity tools, people and processes to test andhelp them achieve continuous cybersecurity posture.Invinsense RBAS will help your cybersecurity systems to observe the entry of adversaries, lateral movements, attack paths, and weaknesses in IT systems and networks. The Red Ops will act like adversaries and will provide insight of current minimum time to detect (MTTD) and minimum time to respond (MTTR).Invinsense RBAS combines everything that is needed to test your environment and make it more matured. Invinsense RBAS covers Continuous Automated Red Team (CART), RedOps, Breach & Attack Simulation (BAS), DevSecOps and Vulnerability Management

## INVINSENSE RBAS- VULNERABILITY MANAGEMENT AND DEVSECOPS:
Clear picture of your organization’s security posture is only possible by testing it continuously. Through DevSecOps, Invinsense RBAS allows you to perform security testing across IT landscape to know yoursecurity posture in real time.
Vulnerability management allows to build central repository of various security testing across the
landscape.

## INVINSNSE RBAS- REDOPS AND CONTINUOUS : AUTOMATED RED TEAM (CART)
Automated red teaming and RedOps of Invinsense RBAS evaluates the security posture of your
organization by using realistic attacker techniques and gives a fair idea about how well your organization is prepared to handle a real attack and where do you need improvements. Major outcomes of this tool are to determine the current minimum time to detect (MTTD) and minimum time to respond (MTTR).

The Key Features Of Redops :
-	Automation of various Red Team Attacks
-	Automated Execution of various Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
-	Helps to identify weak spots in your security setups
-	Helps to strategies red team response, based on the outcome and action of blue team
-	Maps the attack timeline with the response timeline of your security team
-	Gives security teams a hands-on experience of a real incident
-	Trains security teams to handle such attacks which sophisticated

## INVINSENSE RBAS- BREACH AND ATTACK SIMULATION (BAS)
Breach and Attack Simulations allows Invinsense RBAS to simulate attacks and assess the security posture of your organization. It is a cyber security framework used for imitating adversaries Tactics, Techniques and Procedures in a simulated environment

The Key Features Include :
-	Leverages the MITRE ATT&CK model to identify and mimic adversary behaviors
-	Automates penetration mechanism to test endpoint security against the common post compromise adversarial technique
-	Enables automated evaluation of a network security posture against adversaries
-	Evaluates networks for software patch levels,security controls, and defender tools
-	Reduces resources needed for assessments and offloads red teams
-	Helps organizations to fine-tune behavioral-based intrusion detection systems
-	Helps security teams with IoC detection and adversary response
-	As an outcome of the attack simulation, you get visibility of the attack, strengths, and weaknesse of your defense mechanism
-	Helps with the detection and response to adversary behavior
-	Helps fine-tune security policies and other
components of your security setup
